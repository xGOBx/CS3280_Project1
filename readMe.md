# Sales Report System - Rust Programs

## How to Run the Programs

1. **Set Up**:
   - Import the project files into Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
   - Make sure you have the **Rust extension** installed in VS Code.

2. **Switching Between Versions**:
   - To see the available versions, run:
     ```bash
     git branch
     ```
   - Switch to the desired version by running:
     ```bash
     git checkout <branch-name>
     ```
   - VS Code should update automatically. If it doesn't, close and reopen the editor.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Open the terminal in VS Code and run:
     ```bash
     cargo build
     ```

4. **Running the Programs**:
     ```bash
     cargo run 
     ```
